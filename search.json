    "text": "Univalent Foundations\nThis is a somewhat different but a deep field of mathematics that i’m interested in. The ordinary mathematics used by everyone is based on set theory of Zaermelo-Frankel along with the axiom of choice, called the ZFC-system. This system is very robust to formulate almost all of ordinary mathematics (ordinary mathematics is the maths that you do in analysis, algebra, geometry, etc instead of yapping about the foundations of maths)."

    "text": "Here I’ll share my study notes, these notes are somewhat more sophisticated than what typical courses in university cover. The treated is more generalised, and with the highest level of abstraction, but also provide intuitive explanations and concrete examples so u don’t drown. You’ll find pain in reading them but trust me, it’s worth it (jk, I want u to suffer, hehe!!)\nStarting from foundational topics like analysis and algebra i plan to cover more advanced topics in algebraic topology, Partial Differential Equations, Geometry, and Stochastic. In Mathematical Physics, i treat the subjects very rigorouly (sometimes more than required and typically taught in undergraduate courses) to ensure mathematical sophistication for advanced research. The aim of these notes is to train a future researcher in mathematics or/and mathhematical physics.\nThe course on Mathematical Foundations is essentially the “first installment” in the series of lecture notes. So, make sure you have those basics down.\nHuiiiHuiii :3"
