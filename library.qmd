title: "Lecture Notes"

I share my study notes, but with a twist: I re-write them in a more generalized, and highest level of abstract language but also provide intuitive explanations and concrete examples so u don’t drown. You’ll find pain in reading them but trust me it’s worth it (jk, I want u to suffer, hehe)
