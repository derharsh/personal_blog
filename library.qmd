title: "Study Notes :3"
toc: true
---

Here I'll share my study notes, these notes are somewhat more sophisticated than what typical courses in university cover. The treated is more generalised, and with the highest level of abstraction, but also provide intuitive explanations and concrete examples so u don’t drown. You’ll find pain in reading them but trust me, it’s worth it (jk, I want u to suffer, hehe!!)

Starting from foundational topics like analysis and algebra i plan to cover more advanced topics in algebraic topology, Partial Differential Equations, Geometry, and Stochastic. In Mathematical Physics, i treat the subjects very rigorouly (sometimes more than required and typically taught in undergraduate courses) to ensure mathematical sophistication for advanced research. The aim of these notes is to train a future researcher in mathematics or/and mathhematical physics.

The course on Mathematical Foundations is essentially the "first installment" in the series of lecture notes. So, make sure you have those basics down.
