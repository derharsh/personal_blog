title: "Lecture Notes"
---

I share my study notes, but with a twist: I re-write them in a more generalized, and highest level of abstract language but also provide intuitive explanations and concrete examples so u don’t drown. You’ll find pain in reading them but trust me it’s worth it (jk, I want u to suffer, hehe)

Starting from foundational topics like analysis and algebra i plan to cover more advanced topics in algebraic topology, Partial Differential Equations, Geometry, and Stochastic. In Mathematical Physics, i treat the subjects very rigorouly (sometimes more than required and typically taught in undergraduate courses) to ensure mathematical sophistication for advanced research. The aim of these notes is to train a future researcher in mathematics or/and mathhematical physics.

The course on Mathematical Foundations is essentially the \enquote{first installment} in the series of lecture notes. So, make sure you have those basics down.
