Yo! I’m an 18 y-o kido studying maths and theoretical physics. This repo is my "personal space"—a place where I explore the abstract theories that usually don't make it into the classroom until the PhD level bcz I love chaos, hehe.👾😛 This is a place for me to share my passion for mathematics, mathematical physics and chaos gremlin stuff I do👾.
