\noindent These notes were prepared between October 2025 and (tentative) \textbf{(Last update: \today)}.

\noindent If you find any mistakes or typos, please report them to \textbf{caccacpenguin@gmail.com}. I would really appreciate it.

\noindent I often use informal language to make the ideas easier to grasp. My goal is to make the material feel approachable, while still respecting the rigour that makes mathematics what it is.

\noindent I hope you find these notes helpful :D!

\section{Introduction}

\emph{Linear Algebra} is one of the most well-understood theory of mathematics, it also has very wide spread applications to several fields beyond the natural scinces, computer science, engineering, finance and social sciences. Modern age machine learning algorithm and neural network are written in matrices. It probably has more applications than calculus. It is also used for modern treatment of geometry and analysis

Just like \emph{Analysis}, the formal foundation for calculus, linear algebra is really just the formal, general and abstract foundation for concepts like matrcies, vectors and determinants. will not be much of a new subject for most of us. We sure have had experiences of doing calculations with vectors, metrices and determinants which constitutes the matrix theory. Linear algebra. Though the concepts presented here would still be new to some of you, as we will cover more computational techniques than done in high school.

There is a more general course of algebra sometimes called \emph{Abstract Algebra}, a lot of the concepts of linear algebra rely on the concepts from the general theory of algebraic structures. For this reason, our treatment mirrors the continental treatment of Europe and especially Germany. We will start from the elementary concepts of groups, rings, fields and modules and define vector spaces as modules over fields.

These notes present a rigorous and abstract treatment of the concepts of linear algebra in the elementary and more general infinite-dimensional cases. But we will not miss any computation techniques which can be used for several applications linear algebra has. My goal is always to give a comprehensive, historical, philosophical, and foundational treatment and show you the most elegant, modern formalism for mathematics.

The first volume covers basic algebraic structures such as groups, rings, fields, and vector spaces; systems of linear equations; linear mappings and their relationship to matrices; bases, dimension, and linear independence; determinants and eigenvalues. We will also consider many applications, though primarily to the fields of theoretical physics and computer science. Applications to differential equations or other areas of maths are not considered here.

The \textbf{prerequisites} for this course are working knowledge of \textbf{logic, sets} and \textbf{proof techniques}, you can refer to the notes on \emph{Mathematical Foundations} for those topics. Apart from that, only high school mathematics is expected from the readers.

\section{Algebraic Structures}

The modern treatment of linear algebra begins with the discussion of the fundamental algebraic structures of gropus, rings, fields and modules. These structures are defined axiomatically in terms of one or more binary operations satisfying certain properties.
