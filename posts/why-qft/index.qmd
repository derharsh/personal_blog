In my [previous post](/posts/first-post/index.qmd) I mentioned my interest in constructive QFT, gauge Theory and HoTT. To not sound like I’m just a penguin name-dropping advanced research area, I’ll try to describe how I to these fields and why I’m interested in them :3!

When I studied logic the first time I was really fascinated by predicate logic proofs OwO. In fact, I really enjoyed solving proof problems because it followed more logically than cookie-cutter “find the missing trick” problem. I had a fascination with abstract concepts from high school at age 15. This fascination always led me towards more abstract ideas and mathematics and along with my interest in physics I found that QFT as a formal framework is a bit shaky. Path integrals is not really a measure as it lacks sigma-algebra and renormalisation is just a trick which physicists use to sweep infinites under the rug and call it a day (again I hate tricks).

this led me to discover 80s work of Arthur-Jaffe on constructive quantum field theory which aims to formally justify the heuristics physicists use. And that is how I started reading more about this and I’m still learning more ^_^!

This problem is one of the hardest in mathematical physics and people are generally cautious of young students chasing the big problems just because of the glamour. However I believe that my reasoning for chasing this isn’t just glamour but it’s genuine philosophical motivation of rigour in theory. Physicists use QFT and make predict of scattering amplitudes extremely accurately however the tools they are using are a bit shaky and the lack of understanding of why it works is extremely important for QFT in curved space, and to avoid using the rules in wrong situations and get fake solutions.

Servus!!
