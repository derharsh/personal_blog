Here I'll share my study notes, they aren't just copied from lecture notes but are written after taking different perspectives from several resources. They are obviously written in English.

If you find any mistakes or typos, please report them in the comment section. I would really appreciate it.

I am hoping that these notes would be helpful!

## Mathematics:

Starting from foundational topics like analysis and algebra, we cover more advanced topics in algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, partial differential equations, differential geometry, and stochastic analysis.

* **[Mathematical Foundations:](notes/math-priliminary/fom.pdf)** *Basic Logic, Proofs, Sets and Numbers. Prerequisite for every other course.*
* **[Analysis I:](notes/ana1/ana1.pdf)** *Topology and Calculus of Functions of Single Real Variable.*
* **[Linear Algebra I:](notes/la1/la1.pdf)** *Algebraic structures of Vector Spaces, Matrix Theory and Eigen Theory.*

## Mathematical Physics:

* **[Mathematics for Physics:](notes/mfp/mfp.pdf)** *Mathematical methods for theoretical physics.*
